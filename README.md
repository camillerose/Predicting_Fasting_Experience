# Predicting Fasting Experience
This notebook uses data from a fasting app to predict whether someone will have a positive or negative fasting experience. In addition, there is a heavy exploratory data analysis component in this notebook, including k-means clustering, the labels of which are used in a random forest regression model.

## Goals:
- Identify key factors that influence a userâ€™s fasting experience
- Cluster users by engagement level with app and extracts insights about each cluster
- Build a classification model to predict whether a user will have a positive or negative fasting experience

## Approach
1. Explore the data identifying features that are associated with a difference in fasting experience
2. Use K-means clusters and feature engineering to cluster users by app engagement
3. Build and tune a random forest classifier. Use the feature importances to bolster (1).
